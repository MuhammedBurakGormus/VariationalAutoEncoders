# VariationalAutoEncoders
The final project for the class of Machine Learning Approaches in Structural Mechanics. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are used to generate images demonstrating the microstucture for materials shown below. Further, the effect of latent space is examined as well as the numbers of layers in encoder and decoder.
